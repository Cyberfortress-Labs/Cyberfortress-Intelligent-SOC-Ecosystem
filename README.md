# intelligent-soc-ecosystem
### Project Status
This project is under active development. Core functionalities, system components, and documentation are still being built. Features may be incomplete and the structure may change as the project progresses.

An Intelligent SOC Ecosystem that integrates SIEM, SOAR, and SmartXDR to enhance monitoring, detection, and response to cyber attacks. SmartXDR combines OpenXDR tools (Wazuh, Suricata, Zeek, pfSense,…) with AI/ML to reduce false positives, prioritize critical threats, and accelerate incident response, ensuring a more adaptive and effective SOC.
